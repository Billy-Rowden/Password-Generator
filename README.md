# Password-Generator
## Program that will allow a user to generate a random password given certain criteria. 

## Description 

What I have done in this project:

- Written JavaScript code that generates a password by including the following:
    - A series of prompts for the following criteria
        - Length of password at least 8 and no more than 128 characters long
        - Whether or not to include :
            - Lowercase letters
            - Uppercase Letters
            - Special Characters ($@%&*, etc)
            - Numbers
    - Validates each input and at least one character type must be selected

In order so that:

- Once the user has chosen their criteria for the password to be generated, the password is generated and displayed in the text area of the HTML card element.

This challenge was an exciting way to show off what I've learnt so far in this bootcamp in the javascript modules as well as outside research that I have completed to assist me in this project, and an opportunity to work with other students to trouble shoot issues that we were having, and learning how to work through those problems together. I particularly enjoyed finding a vast amount of methods that were used by my peers and I that achieved the same outcome. This has shown me how different our brains work as web developers and yet we can have the same result at the end of the day.

Study groups with Davou Jobbi, Andrea Fontana, Ioana Iosub, Thomas Jack, Lauren Eaton, Laura Kane held to help understand, troubleshoot and debug each others code.

Research on websites including W3Schools, MDN web docs and FreeCodeCamp viewing samples of code to help understand the basic concepts of javascript.

## Features

This is a collection of javascript code that uses while and for loops, if statements, functions and objects to generate a random password for a user given certain conditions chosen by the user. The password is then displayed in a card element in the HTML file.
